d-vote - A distributed voting system based on blockchain technology
===================================================================

The voting process in democratic societies is based on trust among the parties. Individuals rely on the organizing committee that the whole process is handled properly, and that: 
- All votes are taken into account
- All votes are counted and given equal weight
- Voting is anonymous
- No one is hiding valid votes
- Counting votes is error free
- The voting results published are based on the counts. 

In addition the whole process sufferds from a lack of transparency. Individuals has no insight into the whole process

It appears that in practice, in almost all countries elections always end up with claims from all parties - questioning the validity of the results. In some countries this often lead to instability, violence and chaos 

Implementing distributed voting system based on Blockchain technology can generate trust, and solve many of the challenges faced by democratic societies.

This project based on https://github.com/blockchain-academy/how-build-your-own-blockchain demonstrates such implementation

#usage example:
    ./14_d_vote.sh -n 6 -m 50 -k "publickey.pem" 
    This will create 6 nodes, and will simulate 50 random votes

The technical details of the implementation are described in d-vote.md file
